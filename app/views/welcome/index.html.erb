<h1>TellMe</h1>

<h2>Welcome to TellMe!</h2>

<p>I like a lot of different artists, and like any good fan, I follow them on various social media outlets. Unfortunately, all of these outlets are so noisy that I will often miss the release date of a new album. I'm hoping to stop that with this service. The TellMe database tracks artists and their releases, and is designed to notify you only in the event that an artist you like releases something new.</p>
<p>You'll receive, at most, one email per day letting you know when an artist you follow released something. If you want, you can specify a less frequent interval -- receiving one email per week about the week's releases seems pretty reasonable to me.</p>
<p>You can follow bands, musicians, producers -- anyone that might contribute to a release!</p>
<p>If an artist or release isn't currently in the database, feel free to add it. Like a Wiki, any registered user can create or edit anything in the database.</p>
<p>Are you an artist and you want to curate your entries? For a small fee, you can gain exclusive access to your releases, preventing anyone else from creating or modifying them.</p>
